astro_animations
================

Various animations (and some figures) used for teaching introductory
astronomy concepts.  

Python codes are used to generate static images which are then
animated as a movie.  Both the movies and the python codes are present
here.

Note: many of these animations were quickly put together before a
lecture and don't necessarily use the more elegant coding or
libraries.  These will be refined during semesters when I am teaching
introductory astronomy.

Many of the animations are also up on youtube:

`anim_solvers`: support routines for the animations (e.g. a class
that understands a solar system and how to integrate the planet
orbits

`binary_exoplanets`: various animations illustrating binary star
orbits and concepts of exoplanets (radial velocities, transits).

`CFD`: some simple animations that show ideas in computational fluid
dynamics.

`ellipses`: simple animations that illustrate the properties of 
ellipses.

`galaxies`: animations related to galaxies.

`mechanics`: animations showing the dynamics of orbits.

`radiation_thermodynamics`: simple animations showing blackbody
curves and thermodynamics concepts.

`radioactive_decay`: an illustration of the random process of
radioactive decay.

`scripts`: support scripts, including a simple wrapper for mencoder to
string PNGs into a movie

`solar_system_motion`: lots of animations showing the basics of 
Kepler's laws, the Moon's orbit and phases, sidereal vs. synodic
periods, ...

`stars`: figures related to stellar astrophysics.

`waves`: animations related to wave motion.
