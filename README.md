astro-animations
================

Various animations used for teaching introductory astronomy concepts.  
Python codes are used to generate static images which are then 
animated as a movie.  Both the movies and the python codes are
present here.


`binary-exoplanets`: various animations illustrating binary star
orbits and concepts of exoplanets (radial velocities, transits).

`CFD`: some simple animations that show ideas in computational fluid
dynamics.

`ellipses`: simple animations that illustrate the properties of 
ellipses.

`figures`: figures for various concepts.

`galaxies`: animations related to galaxies.

`mechanics`: animations showing the dynamics of orbits.

`radiation-thermodynamics`: simple animations showing blackbody
curves and thermodynamics concepts.

`radioactive_decay`: an illustration of the random process of 
radioactive decay.

`solar-system-motion`: lots of animations showing the basics of 
Kepler's laws, the Moon's orbit and phases, sidereal vs. synodic
periods, ...

`waves`: animations related to wave motion.
