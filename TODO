-- make an animation of the Earth orbiting the Sun, nearly edge-on, showing
   the axial tilt

-- longitudinal vs. shear waves (for earthquakes)

-- propagation of waves through Earth's interior

-- resonance in orbits example (e.g. for Galilean moons)

-- tidal friction: show the tidal elongation of an orbiting moon
   when synchronous vs. non-synchronous rotation.
