`harmonic_law_fig`: show Kepler's third law by plotting log P vs. log
a for the planets in our solar system.  Optionally include Pluto, and
optionally show that the same scaling applies to the Galilean moons
around Jupiter.

`lunar_period`: animate the orbit of the Moon around the Earth as the
Earth moves around the Sun to illustrate the difference between the
sidereal and synodic periods of the Moon.

`lunar_phases`: an animation showing the orbit of the Moon around Earth,
highlighting the illuminated face together with the corresponding image
of the phase of the Moon as seen from Earth.

`mercury_rotation`: an animation showing the 3:2 spin-orbit resonance
of Mercury by visualization an observer on the surface of Mercury.

`moon_rotation`: an animation showing the synchronous rotation of the
Moon by visualizing an observer on the surface of the Moon.

`orbit2`: an animation of two planets orbiting the Sun, with periods
of 1 and 2 years, with the longer period planet in a highly elliptical
orbit.

`orbitalenergy`: animate a planet orbiting the Sun in an elliptical
orbit and show the potential and kinetic energies at each point
of the orbit.

`parallax`: an animation showing the principle of trigonometric
parallax.

`retrograde`: an animation showing the idea of retrograde motion by
integrating Earth and Mars through opposition and highlighting the
apparent position of Mars on the sky before and after.

`sb_over_year`: an animation showing the day/night line over the
course of a year on the globe centered on Stony Brook, NY, with each
frame at local noon.

`second_law`: an animation showing the idea of Kepler's second
law showing three different shaded regions of equal area and 
equal time.

`sidereal_solar`: an animation of a fictitious planet whose sidereal
day is half its year.

`sidereal_solar_day`: an animation showing the difference between
the sidereal and solar day for Earth.

`solstice-equinox`: an spinning globe showing the day/night
line on either a solstice or the equinox for noon UTC.
